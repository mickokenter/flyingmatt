Design by Xiaqin Qiu:

Classes needed to create: 3 classes altogether
class Dice, class Rule, class Elimination.

In class Dice: (for Dice running to generate 2 random numbers)
import java.util.Random for random numbers;
default constructor is necessary; use a() and b() methods
construct a random constructor;
2 Methods:
int a(), int b();
a() and b() are both methods for randoming number from 1~6 each separately;
no attribute is needed.


In class Rule: (for all the running rules to the game)
import java.util.Scanner for input;
default constructor is necessary; use letsPlay() and initiate() methods
construct a scanner:scan;
Attributes are:
int a; for dice 1
int b; for dice 2
int s; for dices' sum
int score; for score calculated
int[] tiles; int array for tiles' numbers
String[] sign; string array for sign of tiles
String input; for inputing a character
boolean status; for loop1's boolean status
boolean inputStatus; for loop2's input character's validation
Methods are:
void letsPlay(); for setting up the loop1 to roll the dices and the procedures again and agin until User pressing Q(Quit), and owns an inside loop2 for check whether the input character is qualified and decides whether let the User to input another character, and assigns the sign for the valid numbers.
void initiate(); for initiating the tiles[i] and sign[i]
void quit(); close the loops and calculate the score, and show() the last Play result
void tryAgain(); for setting the inputStatus to keep on the loop2 and give the "Try again." words
void show(); for show the tables of tiles[i] and sign[i] and some align marks
boolean mark(int m); for judging whether a, b, s are qualified and give the true or false result
String toString(); for print out the score (if someone wants to print the class in addition, show the score only; As all the things have been already printed out)

In class Elimination: (the main method to achieve the running/playing)
Main method;
construct a Rule to start runing


Collaboration:
class Rule and class Dice;

Composite:
Elimination has a relationship of Rule;
Elimination has a relationship of Dice;


Test cases:
TEST CASE						OUTPUT					TESTED?
Whether the Dice gives the right numbers		1~6 each number.			yes
The input characters validation				both lower case & upper case of v/s/q	yes
							are valid, and other input are invalid.	
Whether the align is right				right.					yes
Whether 2 same numbers for Value can be accepted	no.					yes
After input v/s, whether the valid number cross off	cross off the right ones.		yes
the dots
If the number already occupied, new dice number tells	Try again.				yes
"Try again."
Whether the input character does the correct things	v for value, s for sum, q for quit.	yes
Whether the last show is correct			12 numbers, correct crosses, score	yes
Whether the score is right				sum for all the dots' numbers		yes
