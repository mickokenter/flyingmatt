See code attached, try to add the logic to tell the user too high or too
low.


Write a program that plays a guessing game.  The game will pick a random
secret number between (or equal to) 2 set values (a low limit and high
limit) and prompt the user to guess that number until he or she guesses
correctly. On each wrong guess, the game will provide feedback about
whether the user guessed too high or too low. Along the way, the program
will keep track of how many guesses the user has made so far, and will
tell them the total at the end.  Here are two example runs:

What is the low limit and high limit for the secret number? 10 100
Please try to guess my number. 50
Your guess (50) was too low.
Please try to guess my number. 70
Your guess (70) was too low.
Please try to guess my number. 85
Your guess (85) was too low.
Please try to guess my number. 95
Your guess (95) was too high.
Please try to guess my number. 90
Your guess (90) was too high.
Please try to guess my number. 88
Your guess (88) was too high.
Please try to guess my number. 87
Your guess (87) was too high.
Please try to guess my number. 86
Correct!  You got the answer in 8 guesses.


What is the low limit and high limit for the secret number? -50 50
Please try to guess my number. 0
Your guess (0) was too low.
Please try to guess my number. 40
Your guess (40) was too high.
Please try to guess my number. 30
Your guess (30) was too high.
Please try to guess my number. 20
Your guess (20) was too high.
Please try to guess my number. 10
Your guess (10) was too low.
Please try to guess my number. 15
Your guess (15) was too low.
Please try to guess my number. 16
Correct!  You got the answer in 7 guesses.
